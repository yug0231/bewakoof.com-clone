            from us directly to your doorstep without any middlemen that also
            further ensures reliability because for us it is not just about the
            money but about building the trust and credibility in our fans about
            our brand. We also make sure to decrease the impact on environment
            and are building initiatives that will help us with the same, for
            now by optimizing our processes to use only as much as we need from
            nature, rain water harvesting and recycling the water from our RO
            water facility, because we believe that the spirit of Bewakoof is
            about creating an impact by breaking conventions and having a
            different perspective!
